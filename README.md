### Hey there, I'm Chukwunonso âš¡

I'm a backend engineer passionate about learning, software and helping out with my knowledge wherever it may be required.

Mostly based on Go and Typescript, I explore the world of tinkering and building things while teaching others to do so.

Check me out on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/nonsokanu) to learn about my views on software design and code.
